Web Technology
You probably know that computers don't communicate with each other the way that people do. Instead, computers require codes, or directions. These binary codes and commands allow computers to process needed information. Every second, billions upon billions of ones and zeros are processed in order to provide you with the information you need.

So what does that have to do with your ability to post your latest pictures online? Everything.

The methods by which computers communicate with each other through the use of markup languages and multimedia packages is known as web technology. In the past few decades, web technology has undergone a dramatic transition, from a few marked up web pages to the ability to do very specific work on a network without interruption. Let's look at some examples of web technology.

The concept of the web can easily be explained with the help of an example.

Let’s suppose you are looking for a picture of a cute llama. You type ‘www.google.com’ into your web browser. You enter ‘cute llama’ into the search bar and click on the ‘Images’ tab. Google gives you a plethora of llama pictures collected from millions of different sources.

That is the URL (a type of identifier) for this particular image. In the same way, every llama picture you viewed would have a different URL that would help locate that image on the internet.

All these webpages, documents, and any other resources are identified and located with the help of their URLs. These collectively form what we refer to as the World Wide Web.

The knowledge that you accumulate about the web and how it works needs to be applied in order to make better sense of it. For this, you need to know the basics of some common web technologies.
